# **09-02-25 Learning Notes
Try to work more often and faster, you have to do try harder in general
# **Focus for Today
-  [ ] Research Compilers (Also Pre-processors and Assemblers)
-  [ ] Research Interpreters
-  [ ] Look into Differences and Implementations
-  [ ] Look into the steps of processing for computer instructions
-  [ ] Python SQLite CLI To-Do Project
# **Learning Objectives
-  [ ] How does a Compiler differ from an Interpreter?
-  [ ] What implementational differences do they have, and how does this affect Code Generation?
-  [ ] What roles do Pre-processors and Assemblers play in Compilation and Interpretation of Source Code?
-  [ ] How can we leverage these implementational differences to create more efficient code?
-  [ ] How are instructions processed, and how can we leverage this to make our code more efficient?
# **Project(s) / Project Notes

We are going to make a simple python cli tool that can create and store to-do lists; it has the following features;
	- Create/Delete/Update To-Do List(s)
		- Manage Multiple To-Do Lists
